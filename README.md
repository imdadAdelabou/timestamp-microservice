# [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice)

## Description
The first project of the "Back End Development and APIs" module of FreeCodeCamp is to create a timestamp microservice. That means that when we pass a date in normal or timestamp format, the server must be able to return a JSON object containing two keys:
<ul>
    <li> "unix": key that is a Unix timestamp of the input date in milliseconds (as type Number) </li>
    <li> "utc": key that is a string of the input date in the format: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT</li>
</ul>
And some error handling.
